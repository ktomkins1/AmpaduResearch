    the following quantities describe the system:
    E_i         the E-field of the i-th block*
    dtX         the time derivative of the X (dtE_i would be of E_i)
    N_i         the carrier density of the i-th block*
    theta       the phase difference between blocks in a 2-block system
    alpha       the line-width enhancement factor
    LAMBDA      the excess pumping rate*
    DELTA       the cavity optical detuning
    T           the ratio of carrier to photon lifetimes
    t           the time of the system, normalized to photon lifetime
    tau_p       the photon lifetime
